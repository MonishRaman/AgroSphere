AgroSphere
Project Overview
AgroSphere is an AI-powered platform designed to transform traditional farming practices. By leveraging machine learning, satellite imagery, and climate analytics, AgroSphere provides farmers with personalized recommendations on crop selection, farming techniques, and sustainable practices. It empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions, improving yield, efficiency, and climate resilience.

Key Features
Personalized Farmer Profiling

Tailored farming strategies based on individual farmer data such as land size, historical yields, and available resources.
Dynamic Climate Adaptation Planning

Forecasts weather patterns and multi-season scenarios to provide multi-year crop rotation plans for maximizing sustainability.
AI-Powered Soil and Crop Health Analyzer

Analyzes satellite imagery to monitor crop health and soil conditions. Provides insights such as early crop stress detection and irrigation scheduling.
Collaborative Community Ecosystem

Connects farmers through a support network to share best practices, seek advice, and form cooperatives.
Policy and Subsidy Integration

Real-time updates on government schemes and subsidies related to climate-resilient farming.
Disease and Yield Analysis

Image upload for disease detection and soil report upload for yield analysis. Provides detailed insights and solutions.
User-Friendly Interface

Simple navigation through pages like Home, About Us, Contact Us, and Community.
How It Works
Home Page

Displays a welcome message with a time-based greeting (e.g., "Good Morning" or "Good Evening").
Login button directs users to the login page.
Farmer Profile Page

Collects details: name, age, gender, profile photo, mobile number, location (via GPS), and farming type (dropdown menu).
Dashboard

Displays personalized greeting and profile picture.
Options for different farming methods: Subsistence, Commercial, Plantation, Mixed, Intensive, and Organic Farming, each with a representative image.
Farming Method Details

Selecting a method displays a brief description, along with Disease and Yield buttons:
Disease: Upload an image for disease detection and solution based on dataset matching.
Yield: Upload a soil test report to analyze and fetch details from Wikipedia.
Community Page

Direct link to WhatsApp Community.
